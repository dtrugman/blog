Nice to meet you! I'm Daniel Trugman, and [**Trugman Internals**](https://trugman-internals.com) is my way of sharing and giving back to the community.

I'm writing code for roughly two decades, in different settings, languages and capacities, with no intention of stopping. I was lucky enough to find in Software passion, profession and haven.

You can find my blog posts here and my open source projects under my [GitHub account](https://github.com/dtrugman).

Throughout my professional career I envisioned, designed and implemented different security systems for different purposes. from network security, through DB security at [McAfee](https://www.mcafee.com/) and endpoint security at [Palo Alto Networls](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com) to protecting some of the world's biggest companies, such as [Amazon](https://amazon.com) & [TikTok](https://tiktok.com), on all possible fronts.

Apart from Software, I love great coffee (preferably Ethiopian), trekking (in exotic parts of the world), traveling, good food and most importantly, my partner in life, Tania, who makes all those dreams come into reality.

If you wanna discuss something interesting, pick my mind or work together on a project, feel free to ping me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-trugman/).
